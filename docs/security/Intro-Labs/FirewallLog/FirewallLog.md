In this lab we will be looing at a log from an ASA firewall from Cisco.

And wow....  They are bad to work with. 

However, with the power of Bash scripting we can get some useful information.



Letâ€™s get started by opening a Terminal as Administrator

When you get the User Account Control Prompt, select Yes.

And, open a Ubuntu command prompt:

When we first get the logs to the right directory.

On your Linux system, please run the following command:

<pre>cd /mnt/c/IntroLabs</pre>sudo apt install r-base-core

Next, let's get your Linux system to do some math!

<pre>sudo apt-get update</pre>

<pre>sudo apt install r-base-core --fix-missing</pre>

The password is adhd and when it finds the correct package, press Y for yes.  This is a big package. It will take a while.

Now, let's look into the logs.  We are just going to start by using less to view the logs.  No magic.  Just look at the logs.  

<pre> less ASA-syslogs.txt </pre>

That is a nightmare....

The first thing we can see is that 24.230.56.6 is getting a lot of traffic.  This is just a local gateway and we are not interested in it.  Let's clear it out:


<pre> grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | less</pre>

Now, let's focus on the closed connections (FIN) and pull just specific fields out of the data to clean it up.   We use cut with the -d switch to tell cut the delimiter is a space.  Then, we tell it what fields we are interested in.


<pre>grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | grep FIN | cut -d ' ' -f 1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14</pre>

There are a lot of connections from 13.107.237.38.  Let's drill down and see just data from that IP address.


<pre>grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | grep FIN | grep 13.107.237.38 | cut -d ' ' -f 1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14</pre>

Wow! There are also connections from 18.160.185.174.  Here, let's also zoom in on that IP as well:


<pre>grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | grep FIN | grep 18.160.185.174 | cut -d ' ' -f 1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14</pre>

Look at the last field.  See a pattern?  Is there one?  Let's see just that field!

<pre>grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | grep FIN | grep 18.160.185.174 | cut -d ' ' -f 14</pre>


Next, let's some math at that field! 

<pre>grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | grep FIN | grep 18.160.185.174 | cut -d ' ' -f 8,14 | tr : ' ' | tr / ' '  | cut -d ' ' -f 4 | Rscript -e 'y <-scan("stdin", quiet=TRUE)' -e 'cat(min(y), max(y), mean(y), sd(y), var(y), sep="\n")'</pre>
