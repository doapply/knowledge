In this lab we will be looking at a memory dump of a compromised system.  We will first need to decompress it and then use Volatility to look at the network connections and process information for the malware.

Please keep in mind that we are using a free tool for this lab.  While Volatility is great, it does have some limitations.  Specifically in the area of network PIDs.  So, while we are using Volatility, the same concepts can also be applied to any commercial tools you may be using in your environment as well.

To get started, we first need to extract the memory dump using 7zip.

To do this, first open file explorer and navigate to the memory dump and extract it.

First, click on the file explorer icon:

Next, select the tools folder:

Now, select the volatility_2.6_win64_standalone directory:

Next, right click on the memdump file and then select 7-Zip and then Extract Here.  Please note that the file name does not end with 7z on the left display column.  However, on the far right column you can see it is a 7Z file.:

Now we have it extracted!  Let's open a command prompt and look at it with Volatility!

Please note this memory dump was created from VMWare snapshot feature. There are multiple tools like winpmem and FTK Imager that can also create memory dumps.

To start, we will be working with the Ubuntu-18.04 Prompt in Windows Terminal.   This is on your desktop and can be opened by right-clicking it and selecting Run as administrator then selecting Ubuntu-18.04 from the down carrot menu:

Now we need to extract Volatility:

<pre>
cd /mnt/c/IntroLabs/
tar xvfz ./volatility3-1.0.0.tar.gz
cd volatility3-1.0.0/
</pre>

Let's start by looking at the network connections:

<pre>
python3 vol.py -f /mnt/c/tools/volatility_2.6_win64_standalone/memdump.vmem windows.netscan
</pre>


<pre>

</pre>

The above screenshot is... Concerning. We would want to look further into this because it is a SMB (port 445) connection to another computer. We know it is compromised (because it is a lab) but any time a "suspect" computer has another open connection to an internal system is, without question, a cause for concern.

Now, let's look at the processes on this system:

The cmd.exe should catch your attention. Generally, users and day to day usage of a system does not spawn a cmd.exe session. We may see it briefly as part of some sysadmin scripts. However, it is not seen all that often in normal day-to-day user interactions.

Let's look at pstree to see a bit more detail on what spawned what.

Here you can see that we traced back the parent process for one of the cmd.exe files back to TrustMe.exe. When hunting down these processes it helps to track the parent processes. It can help create a sort of timeline for the actions on the system.

In the above example we can also see that the parent process for TrustMe was Explorer.exe. This means it was invoked by the user on the system, as Explorer.exe is the GUI process for Windows 10.

Let's now dive into the TrustMe.exe process a bit further with dlllist:

<pre>
python3 vol.py -f /mnt/c/tools/volatility_2.6_win64_standalone/memdump.vmem dlllist --pid 5452

</pre>

Here you can see the dll's associated with the TrustMe process.

We can also see the command line invocation of this process. This is great as it tells us any flags used to start the process and it can tell us where on the system it was executed from.

Finally, letâ€™s look at the easy button with malfind.  This module will look at the processes for any suspicious activities.
