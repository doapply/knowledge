In this lab we will be running a very simple web honeypot.  Basically, it runs a fake Outlook Web Access page and logs the attacks.  

  

This is a good approach as attackers constantly go after anything that looks like an authentication portal. 

  

Let's get started. 

  

First, we will need to start a Terminal as administrator 

  

Simply right click on Windows Terminal on the Desktop and select Run as Administrator. 

  

Then, select the down carrot and choose Ubuntu.

Next, change directories to the /opt/owa-honeyport directory: 

  

`cd /opt/owa-honeypot/`

Now, let's start the honeypot: 

  

`sudo python3 owa_pot.py` 

  

It should look like this:

Now, let's start another Ubuntu Terminal. 

  

Select the down carrot and choose Ubuntu.

Let's get your Ubuntu IP address. 

  

`ifconfig` 

  

Then, navigate to the owa-honeypot directory. 

  

`cd /opt/owa-honeypot/`

Now, lets tail the dumppass log. 

  

`tail -f dumpass.log`

Now, let's open a browser window and surf to the honeypot: 

  

`http://YOURLINUXIP` 

  

Now, try a bunch of User IDs and passwords. 

  

Now, go back to the Ubuntu Terminal with the log and you should see the IP address and USerID/Password of the attempts.

Now, let's attack it. 

  

Select OWASP ZAP on your desktop.

Once ZAP! opens, select Automated Scan:

When Automated Scan opens, please put you Linux IP in the URL to attack box and select Attack. 

  

It should look like this:

After a while, you should see some attack strings in your Logs.

Yes...  Some attack tools are as obvious as ZAP:ZAP.
